		<h1>Project Euler solutions - DoggoPwn</h1>
		<h2>Each solution contains PDF files with a mathemtical solution, a solution in JavaScript (high-level), C (low-level) and x64_86 Linux Assembly (lowest level).</h2>
		<p>For each problem I try to find a pattern, find a closed-form formula for iterative exercises, or at least simplify as much possible.</p>

		<p><i>If an exercise is not listed here, try doggopwn.github.io/euler/X where X is the number of the exercise.</i></p>
